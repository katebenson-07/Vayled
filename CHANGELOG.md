- **Bookings split into Inquiries / Projects tabs** — `/bookings` now has two tabs: "Inquiries" (status = inquiry) and "Projects" (everything past that stage — booked, completed, cancelled, ghosted). Each inquiry row has a one-click "Convert to project" button that moves it straight to "booked" without opening the booking detail page.


- **Fixed: client wedding date couldn't be edited after creation** — this is why new bookings weren't showing on the calendar. The client page only displayed info; there was no field anywhere to set or change the wedding date once a client existed (the booking page only has time fields, like ready-by and ceremony time — not a date). Added a full editable "Details" section to each client's page (name, wedding date, venue, email, phone, referral source, notes), so setting or updating the date now actually saves and the booking will appear on the calendar and in Upcoming jobs right away.


- **Calendar redesigned as a 3-column dashboard** — `/calendar` now matches the team-calendar layout you shared: a left "Stylists" column (avatar, name, and a live status of Available/Partially booked/Heavy schedule based on this month's job count), the month grid in the middle with each booking pill colored by its assigned stylist, and a right column with "Upcoming jobs" (bride, date, party size, assigned-stylist avatars), a "Team color key," and a per-stylist availability bar for the visible month. Kept the app's existing light color palette rather than the dark theme from the reference image. "Filter" toggles the existing stylist dropdown; "Add stylist" and "New job" link to the relevant pages.

## 2026-08-08

- **Bookings sorted by wedding date** — `/bookings` now lists bookings in chronological order (soonest wedding date first, by month then day), instead of by when the booking was created. Bookings with no wedding date set yet sort to the bottom.
