- **Calendar redesigned as a 3-column dashboard** — `/calendar` now matches the team-calendar layout you shared: a left "Stylists" column (avatar, name, and a live status of Available/Partially booked/Heavy schedule based on this month's job count), the month grid in the middle with each booking pill colored by its assigned stylist, and a right column with "Upcoming jobs" (bride, date, party size, assigned-stylist avatars), a "Team color key," and a per-stylist availability bar for the visible month. Kept the app's existing light color palette rather than the dark theme from the reference image. "Filter" toggles the existing stylist dropdown; "Add stylist" and "New job" link to the relevant pages.

## 2026-08-08

- **Bookings sorted by wedding date** — `/bookings` now lists bookings in chronological order (soonest wedding date first, by month then day), instead of by when the booking was created. Bookings with no wedding date set yet sort to the bottom.
